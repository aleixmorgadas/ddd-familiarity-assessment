# DDD Familiarity Assessment

The DDD Familiarity Assessment goal is to provide you with a set of questions to assess the DDD knowledge within your organization.

:warning: DDD Familiarity Assessment __does not__ intend to be a Maturity Model, and it should not be used as such.

Instead, we expect to help organizations identify DDD knowledge gaps and use the results to prepare learnings, training, or similar to fill those gaps.
